Integration with Cost Allocation Tools: Kubecost seamlessly integrates with popular cost allocation and billing tools, facilitating streamlined financial management processes.


Justifications for Selecting Kubecost:
Kubernetes Focus: Kubecost is purpose-built for Kubernetes environments, making it highly specialized in understanding and managing costs within these complex infrastructures. This specialization ensures that it offers tailored features and insights specifically designed for Kubernetes clusters.
Granularity and Detail: Kubecost provides granular visibility into the cost of individual resources, allowing users to pinpoint cost drivers with precision. This level of detail is crucial for accurately assessing the cost impact of specific resource deployments within a cluster.
Customization and Flexibility: The customizable dashboards and reporting capabilities of Kubecost empower users to tailor their cost monitoring approach according to their unique requirements. This flexibility is valuable for teams with diverse workloads and cost optimization goals.
Forecasting and Budgeting: Kubecost's forecasting and budgeting features enable proactive cost management, helping teams anticipate expenses and prevent budget overruns. By providing insights into future spending trends, Kubecost supports informed decision-making and resource allocation.
Integration Ecosystem: Kubecost integrates seamlessly with a wide range of cost allocation and billing tools commonly used in cloud environments. This interoperability simplifies the adoption process and ensures compatibility with existing financial management workflows.
Community and documentation: KubeCost has an active community and comprehensive documentation, facilitating user collaboration and providing valuable resources for implementation.These also contribute to the tool's reliability and the availability of resources for troubleshooting and best practices.
Integration with DataDog: Datadog is a monitoring and security platform which teams use for cloud applications or cloud monitoring as a service. It integrates your installed Kubecost with Datadog to receive real-time cost monitoring and visualization in your Datadog dashboard


GCP Cost Calculator:
Key Features:
A tool provided by Google Cloud for estimating costs based on resource usage.
Helps in planning and budgeting for new projects or changes to existing infrastructure.
Provides a simple interface for estimating costs across various GCP services.

In conclusion, Kubecost emerges as the most suitable FinOps tool for finding the price of a specific resource deployed on a Kubernetes cluster due to its specialized focus, granular insights, customization options, forecasting capabilities, and integration ecosystem. Its comprehensive feature set equips teams with the tools they need to effectively monitor, optimize, and manage costs within Kubernetes environments.It also provides definition of the environment the cluster is running i.e production, development and high availability We also thought to add gcp Cost calculator which enables us to make much more direct estimates of services in and out of a cluster before deployment as a more proactive way if this is the first time a cluster is being run.
